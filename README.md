# 🧠 AI-Powered Multimodal Claims & Fraud Assessment System

An AI-driven system that automates insurance claim analysis by understanding **both text and images**.  
Developed for the **CHUBB Hackathon Problem Statement 1**, this prototype mimics how an assessor “thinks” — combining computer vision, NLP, and fraud intelligence to generate a unified **Claim Confidence Score**.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Modern insurance claim workflows face two key challenges:
1. **Subjective damage assessment** — inconsistent cost and severity estimation.
2. **Sophisticated fraud** — use of tampered, reused, or AI-generated images.

Our goal is to design an **AI system that can think like a human assessor**, integrating image and text analysis to improve claim accuracy and detect fraud.

## 💡 Solution Overview

This project uses a **multimodal AI pipeline** combining:
- 🖼️ **Computer Vision** – Detects damage type and severity from images.
- 🧾 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Extracts claim details and intent from text.
- 🔍 **Consistency Check** – Ensures claim text and image match logically.
- 🕵️ **Fraud Detection** – Identifies duplicate, reused, or AI-generated images.
- 📊 **Claim Confidence Score** – Aggregates all results into one reliability score.
